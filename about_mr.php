				<h2>Simple, But Not Easy...</h2>
				<p>It seems so simple: just make your customers happy! In fact it takes a lot of hard work to 
				make it happen - but not everyone is willing to make that effort. That very simple concept 
				is the reason Mystic Rhythms was founded in the first place.  Well, not really.  See if this was 
				a REAL Guitar Shop E-Commerce Website, we could probably give you chapter and verse about customer 
				service and blah...blah...blah.  Except it isn't.
				<h4>Here is the REAL story: </h4> 
				<p>Back in 2012, Scott found out about
				a class that taught Advanced Website and Mobile Application Design, taught by Crossfire Consulting 
				in Yorktown Heights, NY.  Scott, thought - Great - I will get back into some web-development and 
				hone skills long since atrophied.  You see, Scott used to be an ASP developer - back when that meant something.  
				Let's just say that new technologies and methods have evolved and Scott was a proverbial dinosaur.
				When he found out the class project was a guitar shop he was thrilled.  This is because Scott is 
				a stuggling guitarist with dreams of musical competance that far exceeed his grasp.  Suffice to say 
				that the projects theme got his juices flowing and, well, here we are.
				</p>		

				<p>Hopefully this guitar shop looks semi-professional and keeps the embarasment of presenting it 
				to the class and professors to a minimum.  Scott really likes guitars and he is a programmer, so 
				hopefully that equates to some kind of synergy - or something.			
				</p>
				
				<h4>I guess I have to leave you with at least one real thing here so here goes:</h4>
				<p>The name of the website is from a song by the band Rush.  Scott LOVES Rush and has since the 
				mid-80's (he isn't all that old I guess).  Mystic Ryhthms isn't Rush's greatest song or even 
				one of Scott's favorites but the title sure looks good as the name for a guitar and drum store, 
				right? </p>
				
				<p> Here is the video of the song as a bonus.  ignore the haristyles and clothes - it was the 80's after all. Enjoy! </p>
